# Setup

To set up the subprojects for development, it is recommended that you run `yarn run install`* once in the root directory of `@feedbax/backend`.
  
After this it is recommended to open the packages seperately in different VSCode workspaces. At least the ones you want to develop. Because everyone ships it's own eslint / typescript configs.
  
  
\* The `run` in `yarn run install` is important because it does not install dependencies, but runs its own installer script.
